UdemyPythonCamp

This repo is where I’m keeping all the Python exercises and mini-projects from a Udemy course I’m working through. The goal is to sharpen my Python skills and get more comfortable using it for test automation.

About Me

I’m a QA Engineer with a background in networking, Linux, and scripting. Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into Python to level up my automation game. This repo is part of that journey—hands-on practice, small projects, and whatever else I build along the way.

Goal

The plan is simple: learn by doing. By the end of the course, I want to be more confident writing Python scripts that actually help in real-world testing—whether that’s for APIs, UI flows, or test data generation.
